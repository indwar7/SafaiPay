# ♻️ SafaiPay – Trash to Cash Platform for India 🇮🇳

SafaiPay is a **Flutter + Firebase powered mobile application** that enables households to responsibly dispose of waste and **earn real rewards** through recycling.

> **Recycle smart. Get paid. Build cleaner cities.**

---



**SafaiPay turns household waste into money.**

India produces millions of tons of waste daily, yet recycling participation remains low.  
SafaiPay solves this by **incentivizing waste segregation** and **rewarding citizens** for recycling.

Households book pickups, garbage collectors verify waste, municipalities gain analytics —  
and users earn **redeemable points** for doing the right thing.

**Clean cities. Smart citizens. Real rewards.**
